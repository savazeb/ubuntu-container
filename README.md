# A Docker Container for Ubuntu
A working ubuntu container dedicated for environment testing. I created this project to help me create linux environment fastly because installing os could take sometimes to done. This little docker container could help me finish my task easily just by run one single command to build or starting the environment.

# Usage
For building, running and starting the container shell use the command bellow.
```
./run.sh
```
